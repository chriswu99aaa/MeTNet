### Overview

We propose an improved triplet network with adaptive margins (MeTNet) and a new inference procedure for few-shot NER.

We release the first Chinese few-shot NER dataset FEW-COMM.

### Data

<!-- We ran experiments on a total of 4 datasets. You may unzip our processed data file `data.zip` and put the data files under `data/` folder.

| Dataset | Notes |
|---|---|
| FewNERD ([link](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/ "20 Newsgroups")) | Processed data available. We used the `20news-18828` version, available at the link provided.
| Reuters-21578 ([link](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html "Reuters")) | Processed data available. |
| Amazon reviews ([link](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ "Amazon")) | We used a subset of the product review data. Processed data available. |
| HuffPost&nbsp;headlines&nbsp;([link](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset "HuffPost")) | Processed data available. | -->


### Quickstart
<!-- After you have finished configuring the `data/` folder and the `pretrain_wordvec/` folder, you can run our model with the following commands. 
```
cd bin
sh mlada.sh
```
You can also adjust the model by modifying the parameters in the `malada.sh` file. -->

### Dependencies
<!-- - Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.6.0
- numpy 1.18.5
- torchtext 0.7.0
- termcolor 1.1.0
- tqdm 4.46.0
- CUDA 10.2 -->
